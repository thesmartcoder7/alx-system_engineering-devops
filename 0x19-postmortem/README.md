# Postmortem

## Issue Summary

On July 15th, 2023, our main website experienced an outage that lasted for approximately 3 hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM (EST). During this period, all users trying to access our website were unable to do so, resulting in a 100% service disruption. The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in our load balancer that led to an improper distribution of network traffic.

## Timeline

- 9:00 AM: The issue was first detected when our monitoring system alerted us about the website's unavailability.
- 9:15 AM: Initial investigation began, focusing on potential server issues.
- 9:30 AM: The server was found to be functioning correctly, leading the team to investigate other potential causes.
- 10:00 AM: The team started investigating the load balancer configuration, suspecting a possible misconfiguration.
- 10:30 AM: A misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified as the root cause of the issue.
- 11:00 AM: The issue was escalated to the network team to correct the load balancer configuration.
- 12:00 PM: The network team resolved the issue, and the website became accessible again.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer. Specifically, the load balancer was not properly distributing network traffic due to an incorrect setting. This caused all traffic to be directed to a single server, which was unable to handle the load and resulted in the website becoming unavailable.

The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to properly distribute network traffic across all servers. This immediately restored the website's availability.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent such issues from occurring in the future, we need to improve our configuration management practices. This includes implementing a configuration review process to catch potential misconfigurations before they can impact our services.

Specific tasks to address this issue include:

- Review and correct any other potential misconfigurations in our load balancer.
- Implement a configuration review process for all network devices.
- Enhance our monitoring system to detect and alert on abnormal traffic distribution patterns.
- Provide additional training to our network team on load balancer configuration and troubleshooting.

This concludes the postmortem for the July 15th, 2023 website outage. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding as we work to improve our systems and processes.
